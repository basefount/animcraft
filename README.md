## What is Animcraft

[Animcraft](https://github.com/basefount/animcraft) (AC for short) is a collaborative universal character action resource library and animation efficiency software developed by [Basefount](https://basefount.cn/).

Animcraft can make any two-legged and four-legged character animation, between different bones, different bindings, different figures, and different software, according to the key frame and controller stable mutual transfer, so you can make the animation and character become permanent Assets are stored for efficient sharing, reference, reuse, training of newcomers, and acceleration of new projects. Make your company's operational resources readily available, revitalized and inherited. At the same time, it also has many auxiliary energy efficiency and productivity functions to improve the efficiency of your animation production and remove obstacles:

**Redirection core**: Allow two-legged four-legged, expression resources, between different bones, bindings, figures, software, according to the key frame and the controller to transfer each other

**Universal character and action resource library**: 3D visualization of resources, efficient organization and management, collaborative use, integration into daily work, reference training

**Rich animation efficiency tool set**: Redirection, real-time surface capture, intelligent animation, streamer calculation, binding conversion, format conversion, nonlinear creation

**Perfect connection between DCC and engine software**: Allow animation and character data to be shared smoothly, flexibly converted, and efficiently utilized between various software

## Features

### 1. Action Storage

Animcraft defines a general animation format, which can store maya, max, mmd, fbx and other animations in a unified manner. Once stored, it can be used in various DCC software.

### 2. Action reuse

One-click sending, importing to biped character, no matter its software, figure, rigging, bone structure, currently supports Maya, 3ds Max, FBX, Unreal Engine, Unity, Human IK, Blender, Cinema4D. Support rich import options such as mirror, speed, frame rate, partial, etc.

### 3. Action Editing

Users can use animation and expression clips to quickly create body and expression animations in a non-linear editing manner, combined with motion capture and retargeting. You can also use bones, combined with animation layers, time sliders, keyframes and other systems to edit animations in all directions. The whole process is non-destructive and can be traced back.

### 4. Binding transformation

The software provides rigging conversion functions for various workflows. Any Maya rigging can be sent to Max to become a CS rigging and accurately restored back to animation; any pure skeleton FBX/BVH or Maya rigging can be easily converted into 3ds Biped binding of Max; binding of pure bone FBX or 3dsMax, and ADV/HIK binding of Maya can also be generated with one click; bones, weights and animations are preserved in conversion.

### 5. Game expression binding

Both max and maya provide a set of basic game expression binding tools, which can fully solve the needs of game expressions. And you can directly convert the expression files bound in maya into max files. Control Animcraft main software or use iphone in maya for facial capture.

### 6. Advanced expression binding

Animcraft provides a set of advanced expression bindings, which can freely define the number of bones to meet the different needs of games and movies. This tool provides a complete weight assignment tool, which can automatically assign high quality automatically. It also provides a wealth of modification tools to meet various binding needs.

### 7. Unreal library

Quickly store special effects, blueprints and various resources of UE, which can be easily reused in different projects.

### 8. Asset library

Animcraft can help animators manage reference animation video and GIF animation resource packs, so that animators can better find references and improve work efficiency. At the same time, these resources can also be used to share with others for training and project production . The support library architecture is lightweight, does not require deployment and maintenance, and manages a large number of resources safely and reliably

### 9. Dragon Breath Ribbon

Using non-integer frame delay and Bezier curve attenuation to simulate elegant streamer effect. Users can intuitively add secondary animations to the character's accessories or streamers, and automatically breathe animations in standby. Support inertia, collision detection, wind gravity, key frame matching, end-to-end loop animation, support Maya, Max, large area coverage of secondary animation requirements of game streamers

### 10. Facial Capture

In Animcraft and Maya, you can use Animcraft's face capture software to capture, and the captured data can be shared in Animcraft's main software, Maya, Max, and edited again.
